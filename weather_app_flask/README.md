## About the App

This is a Python-based weather application that interacts with the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch weather data for any city. It’s organized into three main components using classes:

- `Today` – for current weather conditions  
- `Forecast` – for 3-day weather forecasts  
- `Alerts` – for active weather alerts and warnings  

The app can be used directly from Python scripts or through a lightweight Flask web interface.
